# Power Consumption Prediction (Introduction)
In this project we will apply Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM) which is best suited for time-series and sequential problem. This approach is the best if we have large data. 
The data that we will be using for this project is taken from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Individual+household+electric+power+consumption, we will be creating a LSTM
model, train it on data and make predictions to check its performance.
